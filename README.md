A classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics module. This project is a simple yet entertaining implementation of the timeless arcade game, where you control a snake to eat food, grow in size, and avoid collisions.

   - **W**: Move Up ⬆️  
   - **S**: Move Down ⬇️  
   - **A**: Move Left ⬅️

2. Eat the red food 🍎 to grow your snake and increase your score.
3. Avoid collisions with:
   - The screen borders 🚫
   - Your own snake's body ❌

The game resets if you collide with the border or yourself.
